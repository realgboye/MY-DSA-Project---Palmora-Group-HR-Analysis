# DSA-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project
This is my first Data Analysis Project to test my understanding of training received from Digital SkilledUp Africa.
## This Analysis Project is to look into the data of Palmora Group in order to address some issues of gender equality raised in recent media assertions about the company. 
## Tools Appllied: I made use of Microsoft Power Business Intelligence in order to be able to transform available data and then analyse.
Two data sets were made available - Palmoria Group Emp Data and Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.
I imported the two files into the Power BI environment and tranformed them accordingly.
In the course of transforming the Bonus Rules, I had to unpivot the columns except the the first one representing the names of staff. This enabled me to match the various ratings to their respective values and applied to every staff. 



## MY ANALYSIS
1. Gender distribution in the organization
  - Distilled to Departments 

<img width="1193" height="658" alt="1 Gender Distribution Based on Departments" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1ab250b-58ce-4d1c-a8f0-3fe7526c2b84" />
From the distribution above, Femal were more in four Departments while Male were more in eight Departments
The major Departments that should be of focus are:
  - Legal
  - Reseach & Development
  - Business Development

   - Distilled to Regions

Looking at the distribution based on Region, There is no major concern but attention can be paid more to Kaduna and Abuja in that order.
